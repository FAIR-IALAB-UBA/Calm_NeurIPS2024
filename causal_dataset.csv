"In this study, weather factors in general were significantly associated with OA pain. Many people with osteoarthritis think their joint pain is affected by the weather, while the association between OA pain and weather conditions is still unclear. This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 observational studies for the association between weather conditions and OA pain. Weather conditions appear to be associated with OA pain.

"Our study found that students with higher neuroticism are more likely to engage in media multitasking. This may appear to contrast with findings by Oswald et al. (2007). They found that in a visual-auditory multitasking, neuroticism was negatively correlated with performance. However, it is possible that the tendency to experience anxiety as a feature of neuroticism may decrease abilities for demanding tasks, such as the task used by Oswald et al., but not self-selective daily media tasks. This explanation seems plausible considering previous findings that individualsâ€™ sensation seeking tendency is positively correlated with everyday media multitasking (Jeong & Fishbein, 2007), and the disinhibition dimension of sensation seeking is positive correlated with neuroticism (Zuckerman, 1993). Future research can further explore the mechanism of disinhibition and neuroticism in media multitasking choices.",Study Links Higher Neuroticism to Increased Media Multitasking: A Contradiction or New Insight?,"Multitasking Mania: Anxious Students Excel in Digital Juggling Act""""'","""Anxious Minds"

"In Kerala, India, a cross-sectional study involving spouses of alcohol-dependent males undergoing a deaddiction program reported a high correlation between domestic violence and years of marriage and the number of stressful events in the past year (Indu et al., 2018). In the USA, 40% of the reported domestic violence has the alcohol factor present during the time of the offense (Galbicsek, 2020). It is also found that the intensity of violence is greater when the offender is intoxicated compared to when he/she is not. Based on existing literature, alcohol consumption is more related to the severity of domestic violence rather than its occurrence (Graham et al., 2011) and exacerbated by an increase in consumption (Ferrari et al., 2016). Although there is a clear correlation between alcohol and domestic abuse, these correlations are limited to men and, therefore, form a complex relationship, hence establishing a unidirectional relationship between domestic violence and alcohol is not possible at present (De Paula Gebara et al., 2015).",Alcohol and Domestic Violence: Unraveling the Complex Ties Among Couples,"Unveiling the Complex Link between Alcohol and Domestic Violence: A Scientific Exploration""""'","""Study Reveals Complex Link Between Alcohol and Domestic Violence\n}'"

The slope of the regression line allows us to estimate that it would take about 0.4 kg of chocolate per capita per year to increase the number of Nobel laureates in a given country by 1. For the United States, that would amount to 125 million kg per year. The minimally effective chocolate dose seems to hover around 2 kg per year, and the doseâ€“response curve reveals no apparent ceiling on the number of Nobel laureates at the highest chocolate-dose level of 11 kg per year.",Could Chocolate Be the Secret Ingredient for More Nobel Laureates?
